# dotfiles
Personal dotfiles

This is just the template of my dotfiles, my actual dotfiles are kept in a private repository

To include these dotfiles for personal use, just clone this repository somewhere, for example in `~/dotfiles/`, and run `init.sh`

## Future improvements
- pull and apply changes automatically at login
- add platform specific config (=> no brew on linux)
- get git-completion.bash from the original git repository as a submodule
